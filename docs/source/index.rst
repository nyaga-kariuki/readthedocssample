Introduction to Package
=======================

The code is in Python 3.0 with some SQL used, however one does need to know either to work with the functions. The only three packages imported are numpy, pandas, and sqlite3. The numpy and pandas packages expand the number of possible functions used, especially for data analysis. The sqlite3 package allows our functions to interface with the data base using SQL. Below is the list of functions and links to pages of thier documentation.
